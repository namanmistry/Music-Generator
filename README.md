# Music Generator Project

This project is an implementation of a Music Generator using LSTM networks. The implementation is done using Keras and the Music21 library.

## Overview

The Music Generator uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate new musical pieces based on an existing corpus of music. The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI files, which are then converted to music21 streams for processing.

The generated music can be saved as a MIDI file or converted to an audio file using music21. A demo of the generated music can be found in the `music.mp3` file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following software:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Music21
- NumPy

Note: you have to convert MIDI fiile to the MP3 file if your player doesnt support it. you can convert online for free.
